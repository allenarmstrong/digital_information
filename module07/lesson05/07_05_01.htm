        <p>By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third, by experience, which is the bitterest.</p>

    </blockquote> 
<p>Brain science shows that reflection nurtures deep learning, new ideas, and personal growth. (And, according to Confucius, it's the noblest way for one to gain wisdom.) So you are going to reflect on someone very important: <em>You!</em> You will use your PowerPoint skills to design a presentation to showcase who you are. Think of it as a selfie, but better. </p>
