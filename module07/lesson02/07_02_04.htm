                  	<h2>Going Viral</h2><hr/> 	<p>Are you familiar with the "Ice Bucket Challenge”? This video challenge encouraged people all over the world to pour ice water over their heads or donate money to fund ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) research. This shows the impact multimedia elements can have. PowerPoint slides can also include an audio or video clip in order to add audience engagement and support the overall purpose or message of the presentation.</p><p>     Notice a Public Service Announcement video was added to the bottom, right-hand corner of a slide on the dangers of distracted driving. This improved the slide by adding an emotional touch, which is an effective persuasive technique.</p>
