     	<h2>Convey It With Color</h2><hr/> 	<p> 
Colors convey feelings, moods, and even cultural beliefs. For example, red is often associated with anger, danger, and love, and it has been shown to raise blood pressure. On the other hand, blue is said to have a calming effect. Purple is regarded in some cultures as a symbol of royalty, while green often represents the environment. Therefore, in addition to using colors that will create optimal clarity on screen, you also want to use colors to convey the appropriate feeling. </p><p>
 
<p>Take a moment to check your understanding of colors, contrast, themes, and variants.</p>
