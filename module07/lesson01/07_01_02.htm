    	<p>PowerPoint. Power. Point. The key to an effective <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Presentation:</strong> a lecture, demonstration, performance, or speech" data-position="top">presentation</span> is to wave your hands above your head to get your audience's attention. (Not really. But surprising your audience is a good engagement technique.) The real recipe is to be clear and connect to your audience in some way. Combining interesting text, a purposeful layout, an appealing design, and an exciting image on each <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Slide:</strong> a single page of a presentation" data-position="right">slide</span> will make a bold statement and interest audiences.  </p>

    	 <p>When you open the PowerPoint Online app, select "New blank presentation" to create a brand-new presentation, or select the "See more templates" link and choose an appropriate design template. Using a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Template:</strong> a predesigned format ready to be filled in and customized" data-position="top">template</span> is like using a cookie cutter. You get a unique design without having to start from scratch each time you create a new presentation. </p>
