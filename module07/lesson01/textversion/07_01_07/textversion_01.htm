<h2>Widen Your View&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr />
<p>There are three ways to view your presentation. <strong>Editing view</strong> allows you see your current slide and add and format text and images, see the slide pane to select the slide you wish to edit, and see and edit the "notes" section. <strong>Reading view</strong> provides a wide-screen view of your current slide and allows you to move forward and back. <strong>Slide show</strong> allows you to view your entire presentation the way your audience will see it.</p>
<p>   <strong>Show</strong> allows you to add notes to your slides (these are not visible to the audience when you are presenting) and show the comments you have added to certain text on your slide.  
</p>
          <p> <strong>Zoom</strong> allows you to select a certain size slide view (from 33% to 400%) and fit your slide to the size of the window.</p></div>
