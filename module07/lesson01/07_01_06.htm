 <p>The middle slides are the meat of your presentation. They must convey your message and keep your audience's attention, without giving information overload. Since PowerPoint is often used as a tool to support oral presentations, your audience is listening to you and scanning your slide. Therefore, use the following <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>SCAN:</strong> short and sweet, clear and concise, attention-grabbing, and narrative" data-position="top">SCAN</span> tips to support your message and connect to your audience. </p><p>Select each letter to see the SCAN tips:</p>

        <li><a class="popover" data-position="top"
