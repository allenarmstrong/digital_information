      <h2>Design Makes a Difference</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>PowerPoint comes with preformatted slide designs, which can be accessed in the Design tab. While there are many
          awesome designs, you need to select designs based on your purpose and audience. For example, if you are
          presenting a proposal to City Council members to add a stop sign at a busy intersection, a flowery design
          would not be professional or serious enough. </p>
      <p>Roll over each slide to see what types of presentations are appropriate.</p>

      <div class="view view-fifth">
          <img src="images/depthppt_new_ts.jpg" alt="The slide is a solid blue with large white font."/>
          <div class="mask">
              <h2>Design 1</h2>
              <p>This solid, straight forward design is appropriate for a serious presentation like a business proposal
                  or academic report.</p>

          </div>

      <div class="view view-fifth">
          <img src="images/girlppt_new_ts.jpg"
               alt="The slide is pale pink with green hills, heart-shaped trees and flowers, and a picture box."/>
          <div class="mask">
              <h2>Design 2</h2>
              <p>The flowery design and picture of a little girl would be great for a student who is presenting her
                  autobiography, or for a person making a tribute to a family member or friend. </p>

      <div class="view view-fifth">
          <img src="images/ballppt_new_ts.jpg" alt="The slide has a basketball sitting on a basketball court. "/>
          <div class="mask">
              <h2>Design 3</h2>
              <p>The basketball theme is appropriate for several things like a report on the history of basketball, a
                  presentation to fundraise for the basketball team, or even a financial report for a sporting goods
                  store. When using a theme (sports, nature, books, etc.), you should select based on the subject of your presentation. </p>

      <div class="view view-fifth">
          <img src="images/hppt_new_ts.jpg" alt="The top of the slide has a blue background with white over-lapping circles."/>
          <div class="mask">
              <h2>Design 4</h2>
              <p>The geometric shapes are visually appealing yet neutral enough to be appropriate for business or
                  academic presentations, or even a creative project.</p>
