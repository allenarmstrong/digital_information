<h2>Transition Tab&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr />
  <p> <strong>Transition to This Slide</strong> allows you to apply motion effects when you move from one slide to the other. There are two options available in PowerPoint Online: fade and push.</p>

<p> <strong>Existing</strong> only appears active when you upload a presentation created using the desktop version of PowerPoint. Existing allows you to keep the transition used on the desktop version even though it is not offered on the PowerPoint Online App. </p>

<p><strong>None</strong> allows you to remove a transition from a slide.  </p>   
<p> <strong>Fade</strong> creates the impression of the slide fading in or out. You can apply two <strong>Effect Options</strong> when using the Fade transition: <strong>Smoothly</strong> (content fades on the screen using the existing background) and <strong>Through Black</strong> (a black background appears between slides and then the contents fades on the screen).  </p>


<p> <strong>Push</strong> creates the impression that the slide is being moved from the bottom, left, right, or top. Push has four <strong>Effect Options</strong> to signal the direction of the push:<strong> From Bottom</strong> (slide moves in from bottom),<strong> From Left</strong> (slide moves in from the left), <strong>From Right</strong> (slide moves in from the right), and <strong>From Top </strong>(slide moves in from top). </p>


<p> <strong>Effect Options</strong> allows you to choose special effects for the way the slide transitions.  </p>


  <p><strong>Transitions</strong> allows you to apply your selected transition to all the slides in your presentation.
