<h2>Animations Tab&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr />
 <p> <strong>Animation</strong> allows you to add a motion effect to objects like bullet points, graphics, titles, text, etc. when they enter the slide.</p>

<p> <strong>Existing</strong> only appears active when you upload a presentation created using the desktop version of PowerPoint. Existing allows you to keep the animations used on the desktop version even though they may not be offered on the PowerPoint Online App. </p>

<p><strong>None</strong> allows you to remove a animation from a slide.  </p>   
<p> <strong>Appear</strong> makes the animated object suddenly appear on the slide.   </p>


<p> <strong>Fade In</strong> makes the animated object fade in on the slide. </p>


<p> <strong>Fly In</strong> makes the animated object fly in on the slide. Fly In has four<strong> Effect Options </strong>to signal the direction from where the object will fly in: <strong>From Bottom</strong> (object fly in from bottom),<strong> From Left</strong> (object fly in from the left), <strong>From Right </strong>(object fly in from the right), and <strong>From Top</strong> (object fly in from top).    </p>


<p> <strong>Effect Options</strong> allows you to choose special effects for the way an animated object enters the slide.    </p>

<p> <strong>Timing</strong>  allows you to reorder the animated object in two ways: <strong>Move Earlier</strong> (the selected object will enter the slide earlier than another object on the slide) or <strong>Move Later</strong> (the selected object will enter the slide later than another object on the slide).   </p>
