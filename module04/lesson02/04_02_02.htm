  <h2>Change Your Perspective</h2>
   <hr />
 
  <p>Perspective is a viewpoint. Think of a glass of water filled halfway. An optimist views the glass as half full, while a pessimist sees it as half empty. Sometimes, changing your perspective can help you see things in a new light. The Excel View Ribbon allows you to format the way you view your worksheet.    </p>
