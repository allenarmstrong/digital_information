<h2>Functions&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr /><p>Functions can be used to calculate information in cells. </p><p>To add data from joining cells, use the SUM function. Type "equal SUM" with an open parenthesis, then select the cells to add together. Complete the function by adding an end parenthesis, and hit "Enter." </p><p>Since a relative cell reference was used, the formula will continue to sum up the data in corresponding cells when you fill down.</p><p> Performing multiple functions within a cell is also possible. Using the example here to find how much money is left over in the January budget, you would take the income–cell B3–and subtract the sum of all the expenses–cells B4 through B10–to calculate the remaining balance. </p><p>This formula can be copied to the right to sum up the corresponding columns.</p></div>
