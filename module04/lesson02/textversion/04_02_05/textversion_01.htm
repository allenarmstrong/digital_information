<h2>Logical Functions&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr />
<p>Let's talk about creating logical functions in Excel. </p><p>An IF statement is a logical function. Let's use one to determine whether we are within budget for each month.</p><p> To use this function, type in "equal IF." The formula should pop up for you to follow. Here, the logical test would be for the total leftover amount to be greater than zero, meaning the expenses did not exceed the income. If this is true, we'll have the function display "Great Job." If false, it will display "Redo Budget."</p></div>
