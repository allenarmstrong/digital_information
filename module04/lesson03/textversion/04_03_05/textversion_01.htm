<h2>Adding a Table&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr />
<p>Formatting content as a table allows you to manipulate the data in a bunch of different ways. </p><p>To do this, start by selecting all the cells with the data you would like to convert to a table.</p><p> Next, navigate to the Insert Ribbon and select "Table." </p><p>Since your table has headers, make sure to leave the box checked before selecting "OK." </p><p>Your table now alternates row shading so you can easily see data in the rows. The column header is also shaded and includes a dropdown feature that will allow you to manipulate data in a variety of ways.</p></div>
