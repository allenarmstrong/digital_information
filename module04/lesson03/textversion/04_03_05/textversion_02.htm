<h2>Filtering Data&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<hr />
<p>To filter data in Excel Online, make sure you have data in your table.</p><p> For this example, let's narrow our data to only show 14-year-old females in the 10th grade. </p><p>Select the dropdown by Gender, then filter. Remove the checkmark from the "Select All" box and place a check next to the box labeled "Female." Select "OK." </p><p>Next, select the dropdown by Age, then filter. Remove the checkmark from "Select All" and place one in the box labeled "14." Select "OK." </p><p>Finally, select the dropdown by Grade, and filter. Again, remove the checkmark from "Select All" and place one in the "10" box. Select "OK" and now your data should only reflect that of 14-year-old females in the 10th grade.</p></div>
