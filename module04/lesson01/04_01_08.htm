          <p class="content1"><strong>Save As</strong> gives you several options for saving your workbook. You can save it to your OneDrive, download a copy to your computer, or download a copy to your computer as an ODS file. ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) is a file format that can be opened on all common computers, which makes sharing your work with non-Microsoft users possible. You can also rename your workbook from this tab. </p>
          <p class="content2"><strong>Print</strong> offers you two printing options. You can print your entire worksheet or workbook by selecting the "Entire Sheet" option. Or you can print a partial worksheet. To do this, you must first highlight the range of data you want to print, select "Print," and then choose the "Current Selection" option.  </p> 
          <p class="content3"><strong>Share</strong> allows you to share your workbook with others. You can invite people to view or edit your workbook by selecting the "Share with People" option. Or you can receive an HTML code to embed your document in your blog or website by choosing the "Embed" option.   </p>
