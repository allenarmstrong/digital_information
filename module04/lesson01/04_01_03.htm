  <p>Notice the difference in the data organization? </p><p>Excel spreadsheets organize a <strong>lot</strong> of data into one document, thus eliminating endless stacks of paper. Excel also eliminates the need for a calculator because it can perform both simple addition and highly complex calculations.</p>

  <hr /><h2>Creating a Spreadsheet</h2>
  <p>When you select the <strong><span class="dbtip">Excel<span><img src="images/excel.png" width="50" alt="Excel Online" /></span></span></strong> app in Office Online, you can create a new blank workbook or choose from various pre-styled templates. Once you have a blank worksheet, you are ready to fill in the data. To do this, select the "A1" cell and begin typing. You can use your mouse or the keyboard arrows to move up, down, and across. To move down one cell, select "Enter" on your keyboard. To move right one cell, select "Tab" on your keyboard.</p>
