  <h2>Make a Better List</h2>

<p> Data refers to information and can be anything from numbers and statistics to song titles and ice cream flavors. Take a grocery list, for example. The items on the list are a type of data. When you have a lot of data or the data frequently changes, you need a database. </p><p>A database is a collection of information stored electronically that can be easily modified, organized, and retrieved. Oracle and Microsoft Access are common database software, but an Excel spreadsheet can serve as a simple database, too. </p>

 <p>Why do we need databases to store information? Take a look at the numbers.</p><ul><li>Alibris has over 100 million items (books, textbooks, music, and movies) in its online library. </li>
<li>eBay has 145 million active buyers. </li>
<li>iTunes has over 26 million songs in its catalog. </li>
<li>Whitepages.com has contact information for over 300 million people.</li> </ul>
 <p>Though these figures change as new items are added or deleted, this gives you an idea of the huge amounts of information databases store. </p>

  <p>If you have ever downloaded a movie from Amazon, Hulu, iTunes, or Netflix, then you have used a database. You have most likely performed a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Query:</strong>  a question or a request for information about something" data-position="top">query</span>, too. With Netflix, it would take a long time to scroll through each movie. Therefore, you can perform a query to see a list of only certain types of movies&mdash;like comedies or thrillers. Databases allow you to search for information based on certain criteria instead of having to comb through <em>all</em> the data.  </p>
