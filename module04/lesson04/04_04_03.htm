  <h2>Mail Merge</h2>
   <hr />
 <p>If you were going to make a homemade pizza for eight people, would you make it one slice at a time? Probably not. It's way easier and more efficient to make one whole pizza and then share it. Mail merge is like a pizza, except it's made of text. (Oh, and you don't eat it.) It is a feature of many word processors, like Microsoft Word. Mail merge allows you to create a form letter and personalize it for different recipients by using the information in your database.  </p>
<hr /> <h2>Mail Merge Uses </h2>
<p>Companies use mail merge with their customer databases to send personalized mass emails and advertisements. However, mail merge can be used in a variety of ways other than mass marketing.</p>
