  <h2>Workplace Essentials</h2>
   <hr />
 
  <p>Successful companies and employees know the value of four essential elements: customer service, business ethics, workplace policies, and human relations. In fact, these essentials are often what set apart the best from the rest. </p>
	  <p>Select each slide to see the workplace essentials.</p>

            <h2>Customer Service</h2>
            <p>There is a saying about customer service: It takes months to find a customer and only seconds to lose
                one. According to the Small Business Administration, "Small businesses which put heavy emphasis on
                customer service were more likely to survive and succeed than competitors who emphasized such advantages
                as lower prices or type of product." Providing quality <span class="tooltip"

                                                                             data-position="top">customer service</span>
                is a sure way to keep existing customers and entice new ones. </p>

            <h2>Business Ethics</h2>
            <p>A bad reputation can kill a career. For example, a wedding planner who leaks pictures to the press won’t
                get a call from red-carpet celebrities who value confidentiality. Likewise, a reporter guilty of
                plagiarism shouldn't expect many job offers; copyright violations are illegal. Successful businesses
                know the importance<br> of having <span class="tooltip"

            <p>There is an easy way to stay out of trouble: follow the rules. Certain workplace <span class="tooltip"
                                                                                                      data-tip="<strong>Policy:</strong> a standard course of action adopted or proposed by a government, party, business, or individual"
                                                                                                      data-position="top">policies</span>—like
                those against discrimination, sexual harassment, and smoking—are actually state and/or federal laws and
                must be followed. Other rules that deal with things like dress code, cell phone use, and tardiness are
                optional. Businesses choose policies and procedures that make the workplace more efficient and
                productive. </p>

            <h2>Human Relations</h2>
            <p>The most successful businesses know that people are the most important asset. This is why companies with

                               data-tip="<strong>Human relations:</strong> interactions with or between people, particularly in a professional context"
                               data-position="top">human relations</span> tend to top the charts. The process of
                training employees, addressing their needs, fostering a creative and caring culture, and resolving
                conflicts between different employees or between employees and management is crucial for a happy and
                productive workplace.</p>
