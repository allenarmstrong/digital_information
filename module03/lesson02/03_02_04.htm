    <hr>
    <p>The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) used 260 survey responses (many of them from big
        corporations like Chevron and IBM) to compile a list of the top 10 most-wanted skills in potential employees.
        And to obtain the first five on the list you only need two things: strong personal and interpersonal
        skills. </p>

<p>How many of these skills do you already have? Keep in mind, personal and interpersonal skills help us in our
    everyday life as well as the workplace, and you don't need to take any special classes to improve them. The next
    time you have soccer practice, make it a goal to arrive five minutes early. Or when you're
     faced with a big
    decision, look at all the options, talk to others who have experience in the area, and analyze which option is
    best. You are surrounded by opportunities to practice these essential skills, so take advantage!</p>
