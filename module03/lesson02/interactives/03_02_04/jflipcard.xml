            <text>It's best to adopt the dress of the company where you work. This relaxed and comfortable dress style
                would be very much at home in some corporate cultures. Depending on your job role, you may see many
                different styles of dress in a busy company. Internal staff who never face the customer may have a more
                relaxed style whereas a sales team would have a more formal style.

            <title>Formal Business Attire</title>
            <text>Employers in the banking, real estate, education, medical, and military fields generally have a
                strict dress code that all are expected to follow. You will learn quickly enough what to do. In many
                companies, the dress code varies by the job you hold. A warehouse worker isn't expected to show up in a
                suit and tie.
