    	<h2>Houston, We Have a Problem</h2><hr/> 	<p>In life, you can follow this general rule: The question is not <em>if</em> there will be a problem but <em>when</em>. </p>
<p>Whether you're
	 in school or the workforce, at some point you can expect to work in a group, which can be challenging. Since preventing problems is not always possible, knowing and using <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Conflict resolution:</strong> the process of resolving a dispute or disagreement" data-position="top">conflict resolution</span> strategies is critical. </p><p>Here is a conflict resolution strategy that focuses on respecting people's differences and achieving a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Win-win:</strong> a situation in which each party benefits in some way" data-position="top">win-win</span> solution. </p>   <img src="images/groupmeeting_ts.png"

    	    data-width=""> 	 <ul><li><strong>Identify the problem</strong> – Listen carefully to all parties involved in order to pinpoint the real issue. Ask questions to get to the root of the problem and define it. </li>
<li><strong>Agree upon the problem</strong> – In order to move forward, all parties must agree what the issue actually is. If the parties disagree, <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Paraphrase:</strong> restate another's words using different words" data-position="top">paraphrase</span> responses until the problem is clarified. </li>
<li><strong>Brainstorm possible solutions</strong> – Bring all parties together to come up with possible solutions. This will solve the problem faster, and all parties will feel like they had a role in the resolution. </li>
<li><strong>Negotiate a solution</strong> – Use the ideas generated during the brainstorming session to come up with a solution that is acceptable to everyone involved. </li></ul><br class="clearfix">   </div>
