  <p>The internet gives immediate access to images of celebrities, YouTube videos, books, music, and so much more. Because everything is available at our fingertips, it's tempting to use items for our own purposes. However, just like you must ask to borrow a friend's shirt, you must also get permission to borrow copyrighted artwork, images, literature, music, etc. from the internet.</p>
