    	<p> 	 	At one time, pirates were persons who robbed ships at sea. Today, there is a new type of pirate: a person who uses, reproduces, or sells another's original work without permission. Acts of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Piracy:</strong> using or reproducing another's work without permission" data-position="top">piracy</span> can include downloading music without paying for it, selling a bootleg copy of a movie, or buying a counterfeit watch. Another common type of piracy deals with illegally copying, distributing, or using software. </p><p>Here are some examples: </p>
<ul><li>Borrowing and installing a copy of a software application from a colleague</li> 
<li>Installing more copies of the software than you have licenses for</li> 
<li>Installing and selling unauthorized copies of software on refurbished or new computers</li> 
<li>Duplicating and selling copyrighted programs </li>
<li>Downloading illegal software from a peer-to-peer network, internet auction, or blog </li></ul>

    	<h2>Privacy, Please</h2> <p>Picture this scenario: You are scrolling through a friend's Facebook account when you see a picture of yourself that you hate! (You know the one with the bad haircut.) You really wish this image could be removed. </p><p>Good news! We all have privacy rights. Because content in the digital world is considered "eternal," laws like the "right to be forgotten" law have been enacted, which allows users of the internet to remove damaging or unwanted data about themselves. In general, it is the responsibility of the internet service provider or social media site, such as Facebook, to remove all instances of the unwanted material when requested. Keep in mind, finding all instances where the unwanted content is posted can be challenging, so post carefully and be vigilant about checking social media sites where data about you may appear.</p>
