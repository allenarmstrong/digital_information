  <h2>Copyright <em>vs </em>Copy Wrong</h2>
   <hr />
 
  <p>The word "copyright" is a little misleading. After all, we all know it is not right to copy. However, few people really understand <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Copyright:</strong> the exclusive legal right, given to an originator or creator, to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same" data-position="top">copyright</span> laws. Basic copyright law provides protection to the authors of "original works of authorship." Original works include art, architecture, apps, cartoons, choreography, literature, music, photography, sculpture, softwareâ€”pretty much anything that a person creates from his or her own imagination. Not only is it <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Ethical/Unethical:</strong> in/out of accordance with the rules or standards for right conduct or practice" data-position="top">unethical</span> to violate copyright laws, it is illegal.</p>
  
  <img src="images/CopyrightChalkboard_ts.jpg" alt="Copyright Word Cloud on a chalkboard" class="pull-right showcase frame"> 	<p>Copyright law is in place to protect the person who owns the copyrighted material from unlawful use of his or her hard work. These items will give you an idea of how the law operates: <ul>
<li>You may not reproduce a written work or recorded work without the owner's permission. 
</li><li>You may not alter someone else's work to make it your own without permission.</li> 
<li>You cannot sell someone else's writing, music, or recording for your sole benefit.</li> 
<li>You may not perform a copyrighted work publicly without the owner's permission.</li> 
<li>You may not display a copyrighted work publicly without the owner's permission. </li>
<li>You may not perform the work publicly (in the case of sound recordings) by means of a digital audio transmission without the owner's permission. </li></ul> 
<p>When you find something online, make sure it is part of the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Public domain:</strong> belonging or being available to the public as a whole, and therefore not subject to copyright" data-position="top">public domain</span>. That way, you will not need permission to use it.</p></div>
