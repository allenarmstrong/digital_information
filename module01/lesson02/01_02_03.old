    <h2>A File Type for Every Conceivable Task</h2>
    <hr/>
   
       	 <p>At different levels in a computer's file storage, you can find different <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>File formats:</strong> the way data is encoded and stored" data-position="top">file formats</span>. A file format is a way
        that data is stored as a file, whether as a document, image, a video, etc. File formats are linked to certain
        programs. Some file formats are not only specific to the program that uses them, but also the operating system
        they are used on.</p><br>

    <p>Every file has one or more programs that can open that kind of file so you can access the file, such as to change
        it or view it. There are countless kinds of file types, but this chart shows examples of common ones. You only
        need to know the file types that you use most often. </p><br>

    <p>Select each image below for information on the common <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>File extensions:</strong> the letters after a period in the filename that indicate the file format" data-position="top">file extensions</span>
     for each type of file.</p>
