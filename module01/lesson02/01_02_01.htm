         <hr />
        <p>Let's talk data. The smallest unit of data a computer uses is called a bit. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. This system can translate information such as a simple Yes or No. However, when we talk data today, weâ€™re more often using gigabytes (GB) as our unit of measurement. A single gigabyte is roughly equivalent to 1 billion bytes. So how much file storage is that? One gigabyte can hold approximately:</p>
 
<ul><li>    894,784 pages of plaintext (1,200 characters)</li>
<li>  4,473 books (200 pages or 240,000 characters)</li>
<li>  640 web pages (with 1.6MB average file size)</li>
<li>   341 digital pictures (with 3MB average file size)</li>
<li>   256 MP3 audio files (with 4MB average file size)</li></ul>
 
<p>Chances are, whatever device you're using, it's got more than just one GB. That's a lot of document, music, picture and other files.  The key? Staying organized.</p><br>
