      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>Computer speed continues to advance and its memory is another key factor in how your computer performs. There are
    two types of memory that impact how your computer functions, <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>ROM: provides information to devices but is not written to by the user</strong>" data-position="top">Read-Only Memory </span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>RAM: allows the user to both read and write to this memory to improve the computer's functionality</strong> " data-position="top">Random Access Memory</span>. </p>

          <thead>
        <tr>

            files and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Firmware software:</strong> set of instructions that tells electronic devices how to operate" data-position="top">firmware software</span>. Another example of a ROM would be a CD for a video console. The video game is preloaded on the CD; the user can play the game, however, is not able to write to
            the CD. ROM data is not dependent upon power in order to remain stored.</p> </td>
