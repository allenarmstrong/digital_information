	<div class="col-sm-7"><p>Since you're using one now, weâ€™re going to guess that you're digitally literate. You can turn it on and off, stream music, watch movies, check your email, compose Pulitzer-worthy writing in a word doc, and probably a lot more. </p>
<p>We know why a computer works (because the guy at the store said it would), but let's talk about <em>how</em> it works.</p>
<p>Computers are broken down into three basic parts: </p>
<ul><li><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>CPU:</strong> the main chip in a computer and another name for microprocessor" data-position="top">central processing unit </span></li><li><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Memory: </strong> stored information for the computer to perform its intended function" data-position="top">memory</span>
</li><li><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Input device:</strong> a peripheral that provides information to the computer" data-position="top">input/</span><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Output device:</strong> a peripheral that delivers information to the user" data-position="top">output</span>
 devices</li></ul>
<p>These parts make up the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Computer architecture:</strong> the selection and interconnection of hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals" data-position="top">computer architecture</span>, without which your computer would not work.</p>
