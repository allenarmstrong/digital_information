  	<h2>Peripherals</h2>     <hr /> 	  	    		 <p><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Peripherals:</strong> devices that connect to a computer to provide input or output functions " data-position="right">Peripherals</span>&mdash;sound familiar? You've probably heard of "peripheral vision"&mdash;that's what you're able to see outside of your main line of sight. Peripherals on computers are similar&mdash;they’re any devices that connect to a computer (keyboards, mouse, USB, etc.) and are used as input or output devices for that computer. While they’re not part of the main computer, they definitely help increase the computer's functionality, just like peripheral vision increases your overall field of view.  </p><p>
There are tons of different kinds of peripherals. Some allow you to do and see basic computer functions, while others can assist you in performing more advanced tasks.

 <br><p> Peripheral technology continues to advance, making your life easier. Touchscreen technology is now part of daily use; however, a few years ago, it was too expensive for many people have in their home&mdash;similar to 3D printers today. Just like how the cost of touchscreens came down, so will the cost of 3D printers, making them more affordable for families to own. Can you imagine how peripherals will change our lives next?</p>
