  <h1><span class="unlock lname">Networks and What They Do</span></h1>
  <hr />
  <p>We know what the internet is and why we use it. Networks answer the question we don't often ask, which is "how?" We know that when we type something into our browser search bar, it connects to the internet and serves up what weâ€™re looking for. Understanding how computers are connected and the networks they use is just as important as the "what" and the "why" because neither of those matter if you don't know "how." </p>
