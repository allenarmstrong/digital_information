  <h2>Workplace Communication</h2>
  <hr/>
  <p>"Working from home" nowadays is a thing&mdash;and a really common one, at that. Many schools and companies today allow their students or employees to work remotely&mdash;meaning from home, a coffee shop, or, really, anywhere with Wi-Fi. Whether completing your online assignments or working from home, email and phone calls are great ways to stay connected, but those forms of communication are not enough. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Below are other tools used to keep people connected and productive:</p>
