  <h2>Types of Computer Networks</h2>
  <hr />
  <p> A computer network is what allows computers and devices to talk to each other. A computer without a network is like a city without roadsâ€”everything would exist but would have no way of getting from one place to another. Two common types of computer networks are <strong>client/server networks</strong> and <strong>peer-to-peer networks</strong>.</p>

      <h2>What is a client/server network? </h2>
      <p>A client/server network is one that has a central, powerful computer (called the <strong>server</strong>) that acts as a hub for other, less powerful computers or devices (called <strong>clients</strong>) to connect to. Clients have the ability to access content and run applications on the server but not on another client device. Facebook is an example of a client/server network. Users (like you) are clients. When you upload a photo, it is stored on Facebook's server. Other users (like your friends) can see and download the posted photo because they are also using Facebook's client/server network. Your grandma (who isn't on Facebook)&mdash;not so much. </p>

      <h2>What is a peer-to-peer (P2P) network? </h2>
      <p>A peer-to-peer network is when computers connects to other computers to share information without going through a main server. Each computer runs its own software, stores its own data, and can be accessed by other computers on the network. Sharing pictures via Bluetooth is an example of peer-to-peer networking. When you connect your computers or smartphones via Bluetooth, both devices have the ability to access each other's information directly without having to go through a server. </p>
