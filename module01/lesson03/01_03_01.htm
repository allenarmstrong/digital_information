  <hr />
  <p>Whether we'll admit it or not, there's a difference between cleaning your room and shoving everything under your bed or in your closet so it "looks clean." When everything is put in its proper place and trash is cleaned out, it's much easier to find what you need (and let's be honest, it probably smells better, too). The same goes with your computer. Keeping up with the inside and outside of your computer will extend its life, not to mention keep it from crashing on you unexpectedly. </p><br />
