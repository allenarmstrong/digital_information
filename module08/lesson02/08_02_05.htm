<p>Warning: The word <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Interview:</strong> a formal meeting, usually to evaluate qualifications (as of a prospective student or employee)" data-position="top">interview</span> can elicit spontaneous sweaty palms, a dry mouth, and a loss for words. But it doesn't have to. In fact, there are many ways to cope with the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Stress:</strong> a condition that can cause physical or emotional symptomsâ€”loss of appetite, increased heart rate, anger, crying, sleep issues, etc." data-position="top">stress</span> of an interview (and life). For instance, eating healthy meals, exercising regularly, and getting plenty of sleep are good ways to take care of yourself. Talking to others about your feelings is an important part of stress management, too. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, the better prepared you are for an interview, the less  anxious you will be. So read the suggestions for before, during, and after an interview.</p>

<p>Before you interview, there is one rule: <b>Prepare, prepare, prepare!</b></p> 
<p>These steps will help you effectively prep for an interview: </p>
 <img src="images/before_ts.jpg" alt="Image of a clock and the phrase 'Time to plan.' " class="pull-right frame top-flush"/> 
<ol>
	<li>Research the company. Use its website to gain information about its <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Executive:</strong> a person with senior managerial responsibility in a business organization" data-position="top">executive</span> team, mission, strengths, culture, and industry trends. </li>
<li>Practice answering these typical <a href="pop/interview.htm" class="pop"><strong>interview questions</strong></a>. You can never predict exactly what the interviewer will ask, but it helps to have some answers to standard questions. </li>
<li>Prepare concise stories based on your experiences that show your ability to do the job. Short, relevant stories help you stand out from the competition.</li> 
<li>Rehearse the first 30 seconds of the interview. First impressions make the biggest impact, so rehearse what you are going to say when you meet the hiring manager.  
</li><li>Choose an outfit that will visually show you're the right person for the job. 
</li>
<li>If you feel stressed about the interview, talk to a friend, family member, counselor, teacher, or someone else you trust.
</li>

            <hr />

<p> 
During the interview, make sure you do the following: </p><ul><li>Make eye contact to show you're confident and direct, and smile to show you're friendly. </li>
<li>Speak clearly to demonstrate you have strong verbal communication skills. </li>
<li>Be flexible. Even with preparation, you can never predict exactly how the interview will go. A good candidate will adjust to play to different situations. So periodically ask yourself: Do I need to supply better answers? Do I need to work on my tone? Do I need to just shut up?  </li>
<li>Stay calm. If you think the interview is going poorly, take a deep breath and just concentrate on the question being asked. (By the way, deep breathing is actually a stress buster. It releases oxygen to the brain, which literally makes you feel calmer.)
</li>  
<li>When the interview is over, shake the hiring manager's hand, thank him or her for the opportunity to meet, and ask if it's okay to follow up by phone or email to check on the status of the position. 
</li></ul>

<p>Whew! The hard part is over. So what do you do now?  </p>
<img src="images/after_ts.jpg" alt="Image of a businesswoman jumping for joy." class="pull-right frame top-flush"/> 
<ol><li>Send a thank you letter/email <strong>immediately</strong> following the interview. Thank the interviewer for meeting with you and recap why you're the right person for the job. </li>
<li>If the hiring manager agreed to a follow-up call or email during your interview, reach out within five to 10 business days. Ask about the status of the position and whether the hiring manager needs any other information from you.</li></ol>
