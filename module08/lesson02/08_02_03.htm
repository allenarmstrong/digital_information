    <h2>Getting the Gold</h2>

    <p>The job market is a lot like an Olympic event. Instead of a gold medal, though, you are competing against others
        for a paying job (which is as good as gold!). Before you ever meet a potential employer face-to-face, you will
        go through the pre-qualifying round by submitting your <span class="tooltip"
                                                                     data-tip="<strong>Résumé:</strong> a short document describing your education, work history, skills, etc. that you give an employer when applying for a job"
                                                                     data-position="top">résumé</span> and <span
                class="tooltip"
                data-tip="<strong>Cover letter:</strong> a letter that is sent with something to explain the reason for it or to give more information about it"
                data-position="top">cover letter</span>. These items make a first impression, so they need to showcase
        your skills, experience, education, and accomplishments in a winning way. </p>

    <h2>Rock Your Résumé </h2>
    <p>Think of your résumé as a first impression. On average, potential employers spend about 6.25 seconds reading your
        résumé. That means you have to make a BIG impact in a short amount of time. So how do you do that?</p>
    <p> Look at the essential elements a résumé must have. </p>

                                             data-tip="<strong>Name/Surname:</strong> Place your first and last name at the top of your résumé. Use a larger font size to catch the
        reader's eye. Your name should be the biggest item on your résumé."

                                                data-tip="<strong>Profile:</strong> This section is a great place to briefly tell employers who you are and highlight your
        achievements—as long as they are relevant to the job. For example, if you're applying for an internship at a law
        office, listing the tricks you mastered on your skateboard isn't relevant to the job. However, successfully
        getting approval from city council to build a skate park in your neighborhood shows determination, leadership,
        and initiative."

        If you don't have any 'real' job experience, list babysitting, cleaning, pet care, and volunteer work experience
            and briefly describe your duties."

    <h2>Get Noticed</h2>
    <p>In a field of daisies, be a sunflower. What does this mean in a job search? You have to make your résumé stand
        out from the rest in order to get noticed. </p>
    <p>Here are seven strategies to catch your reader's attention and keep them reading: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make your name BIG and <strong>bold</strong> at the top. This should grab your reader's eye.</li>
        <li>Use <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Keyword:</strong> a word or concept of great significance"
                      data-position="top">keywords</span> to emphasize skills and achievements.
        </li>
        <li>Make these action words.</li>
        <li>Stick to one or two font styles and make them easy to read. Struggling to decipher fancy fonts will only
            frustrate your reader.
        </li>
        <li>Use a larger font size for headings and a smaller font size for content. This is a great way to chunk
            information in a visually-organized manner.
        </li>
        <li>Use bullet points sparingly in any one section. Aim for no more than five to seven to avoid bullet
            overload.
        </li>
        <li>Add some color, carefully. A pop of color will make your résumé stand apart from the stack of black and
            white ones.
        </li>
        <li>Proofread, proofread, proofread! Spelling and punctuation really do make a difference.</li>
    </ol>
