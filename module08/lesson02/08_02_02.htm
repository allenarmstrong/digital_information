    <p>Download and complete this <a href="pop/sample_job_app.pdf" class="modal-pop">sample application</a> in advance,
        so all your work-related dates, addresses, phone numbers, references, etc. are in one place. Many employers will
        not consider incomplete applications, so write in N/A (meaning "not applicable") in areas that do not apply to
        you.</p></div>
