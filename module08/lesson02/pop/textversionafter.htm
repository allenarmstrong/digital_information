<p>Catelyn Stark<br>567-555-4545 myemail@me.com 1234 Main Street, Anytown, FL  34567</p><p>December 1, 2015<br>Human Resources<br>Acme Intl Inc<br>4321 First Street<br>Anytown, GA 45678</p><p>Dear Hiring Manager:</p><p>It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position of Sales Coordinator for the Westeros Castle Project. As an administrative professional with over ten years&#39; experience, I know my diverse skills and qualifications will make me an asset to the Westeros project team. </p><p>As you will see from the attached resume, I&#39;ve built my career in a variety of roles and industries, mostly in small companies where I was not just the admin but also gatekeeper, technology whiz, bookkeeper and marketing guru. I&#39;m not only used to wearing many hats, I sincerely enjoy it; I thrive in an environment where no two work days are exactly the same. </p><p>In addition to being flexible and responsive, I&#39;m also a fanatic for details &ndash; particularly when it comes to presentation. One of my recent projects involved coordinating a 200-page grant proposal: I proofed and edited the narratives provided by the division head, formatted spreadsheets, and generally made sure every line was letter-perfect and that the entire finished product conformed to the specific guidelines of the RFP. (The result? A five-year, $1.5 million grant award.) I believe in applying this same level of attention to detail to tasks as visible as prepping the materials for a top-level meeting and as mundane as making sure the copier never runs out of paper. </p><p>Last but certainly not least, I want you to know that I&#39;m a passionate Westeros fan and a longtime supporter of the new castle. I&#39;ve been following the new castle movement since the earliest days of the original &#34;Save the Tombs&#34; campaign, and I am so excited to see this vision becoming a reality. I&#39;ve already checked out the new castle website, and the renderings of the new throne and great hall are stunning to say the least &ndash; I particularly love the vintage murals and art featured throughout the building. Nice touch! </p><p>In closing, I am thrilled at the possibility of being involved in the new castle almost literally from the ground up, and would love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the value that I can bring to the Targaryen organization and the Westeros Castle Project. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you. </p><p>Warmest regards, <br>Catelyn Stark </p>
