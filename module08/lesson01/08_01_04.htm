        <h2>Plan a Better Future</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Benjamin Franklin is credited with saying, "If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail." Basically, this means you need to make a plan if you want to succeed in life and in your <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Career:</strong> an occupation performed for a significant period of a person's life and with opportunities for progress" data-position="top">career</span>. Consider the following questions:</p>

                    <h2>What is most important to you?</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>On a scale of 1-10 (one being most important and 10 being least), how would you prioritize
                            the following areas of your life: academics, creativity, faith, family, health and fitness,
                            hobbies, money, public service,
                            social interactions, and travel?</p>
                        <p>Once you know your main priorities, you can set goals and make a plan that supports your
                            values.</p>

                        <p>So you really love basketball, but you're actually better at algebra.</p>
                        <p>Take your skills into consideration when planning for your future. You can always find a
                            pick-up game on the weekends, but making it to the NBA requires high
                            levels of skill and talent. A career in finance seems like a more logical path. </p>

        <p>Once you figure out what's important to you and what you're good at, look at the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Labor Market:</strong> the supply of available workers in relation to available work" data-position="top">labor market</span>. Evaluate how local and global <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Trend:</strong> a general direction in which something is developing or changing" data-position="top">trends</span> impact the workforce, so you can align your goals and values with actual job <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Prospects:</strong> the possibility or likelihood of some future event occurring" data-position="top">prospects</span>. For example, if making a lot of money is your number one goal, a career in forestry (which is expected to decline by 6% by 2024) may not be the best choice.
