             <p>Do you want a career someday? If so, you will need two types of skills: <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Hard skills:</strong> specific, teachable abilities (i.e. reading, solving equations, and using software, etc.) that can be defined and measured" data-position="top">hard skills</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Soft skills:</strong> character traits and interpersonal skills that characterize a person's relationships with other people" data-position="top">soft skills</span>. Different occupations require different sets of hard and soft skills, and some believe your hard skills will get you the interview while your soft skills may actually get you the job. Let's look at two careers and their necessary skills. </p>

 <p>Whether you want to become a carpenter, doctor, graphic designer, mechanic, or web developer, you can learn the hard skills through proper education and training. Soft skills, on the other hand, are not as easily learned because they are more like <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Personality traits:</strong> the reflection of people's typical patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors" data-position="top">personality traits</span>. Take every opportunity you can to strengthen your hard skills (take a class, read a book, do some research, etc.) and plump up your soft ones (be on time, listen to others, work in groups, etc.).</p>
