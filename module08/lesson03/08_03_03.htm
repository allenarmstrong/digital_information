  <h2>Climb Higher</h2>

  <p>If you think getting the job is the end of the road when it comes to reaching your career goals, guess again. Companies are constantly trying to grow and improve, and the same is expected of employees. For that reason, if you want to advance, you have to do two things: enhance your current skills and increase your skill set. One of the ways to do this is to design an effective <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Professional development:</strong> the advancement of skills or expertise to succeed in a particular profession through continued education and facilitated learning opportunities" data-position="top">professional development</span> plan.</p>
  <br class="clear"/>
  <p> Here are questions to help you evaluate your current job and skills, determine what skills/knowledge you're lacking, and then seek ways to improve:  </p>
<ol><li>What is the job you have or want? </li>
<li>What are the required skills? 
</li><li>What are my current skills?</li> 
<li>What are my areas of improvement?</li> 
<li>What learning opportunities exist in these areas?</li></ol>

                   <p>Students, and those just starting to think about their future, use the development questions to do the following: explore possible careers; identify the necessary skills for a particular job; evaluate their existing skills; determine what skills they need to get the job they want; and find learning opportunities like college, vocational training, and certificate programs.</p>         </div>

                   <p>The development questions may seem geared toward job seekers and employees, but anyone who wants to improve a skill can use them. For example, if a pitcher is trying to improve his or her game, the questions can identify what areas need to be improved and what opportunities exist for training. After all, why keep working on and studying a fast ball when it's your curve ball that needs work.</p>               </div>

                      <p>When you have a job, the way to advance (which can often mean more money and benefits) is to keep growing and learning. Using the development questions will help you evaluate your current status, so you can identify areas of weakness. Once you know what you need to work on, you can find professional development trainings that will enhance your skills and even provide you with new ones.</p>               </div>
