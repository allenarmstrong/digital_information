  <h2>Get Yourself a Guru</h2>

<p>Oprah had one. Mother Teresa had one. Luke Skywalker had one. In your search for professional development and learning opportunities, nothing may be more valuable than a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Mentor:</strong> an experienced and trusted adviser" data-position="top">mentor</span>. In your life, you have probably had a teacher, a coach, a family member, or even a peer act as a person who has given you advice and guidance. It's good to have one in your career as well.</p>
<br class="clear"/>
<p> Here is what a good mentor can do:  
<ul><li>share knowledge, expertise, and skills with you </li>
<li>increase your self-confidence by giving you a support system</li> 
<li>provide you with an important <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Networking:</strong> interacting with other people to exchange information and develop contacts, especially to further one's career" data-position="top">networking</span> contact </li>
<li>advise you on how to accept feedback in important areas, such as communications, technical abilities, change management, and leadership skills 
</li><li>share personal successes and failures, so you can learn what to do and what not to do </li></ul>
<p>So how do you find a mentor? Look to the people in your community (think <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Association:</strong> a group of people organized for a joint purpose" data-position="top">associations</span> you belong to, activities you're involved in, neighbors, and relatives) who are 10 steps ahead of you in the career you want. Instead of asking him or her to be your mentor—which can sound like extra work—ask for advice on a specific problem. If you show your excitement at working together and your gratitude for the advice, a mentor and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Mentee:</strong> a person who is advised, trained, or counseled by a mentor" data-position="right">mentee</span> relationship can build from there.</p>
