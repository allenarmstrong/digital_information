    <li>Misspelled words on a Word Online document are underlined in red. When the <strong>Spelling</strong> tool is
        selected, correct spelling options appear for the first misspelled word. Selecting the word's proper spelling
        from the menu automatically corrects the misspelled word. The <strong>Spelling</strong> tool should be used
        until the message stating, "Spell check complete. No mistakes were found." appears.
    </li>
          <li>The <strong>New Comment</strong> tool is a resource for you, or those you share your documents with, to make notes in the margins. To use this tool, highlight the place in your document where you want to add a note, select New Comment, and add your note.</li>
          <li>You can access previous versions of your Word Online documents. To track your document versions,  go to the <strong>OneDrive</strong> app, select the <strong>Documents</strong> folder, right-click the document you want to track, and select <strong>Version history</strong>. A list of the document versions will appear in the left margin. When you select a previous version, you can download or restore that <strong>version</strong>.</li></ol>
