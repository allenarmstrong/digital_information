  <h2>Insert: The Easy Button</h2>
  <hr />

  <p>Wouldn't it be nice if everything had an easy button? Well, Word Online kind of does. There are many features to simplify creating a Word document, so you can focus on the challenging stuff&mdash;like unlocking your next achievement on your favorite game.</p>

        <h4>Page Breaks</h4><hr />
        <p>When using a Word document, you may need to start a brand new page before you actually get to
            one. Many people just hit the Enter key over and over and over until the cursor reaches a new page. Good
            news! There is an easier way. Go to the Insert tab and use the Page Break command to start a new page at your current location.</p>

    <a class="tab" title="header_title">Headers and Footers</a>
    <div class="panel">
          <h4>Headers and Footers</h4><hr />
           <p>A header is text located at the top of a Word document that recurs on each page, and a footer is text that recurs on the bottom of each page. Watch this video to learn how to use the <strong><span class="dbtip">Header&nbsp;&&nbsp;Footer<span><img src="images/header_footer2.png" width="50" alt="Header and Footer"/></span></span></strong> Footer tool, so your text automatically repeats at the top and/or bottom of each page.</p>

    <div class="panel">
          <h4>Hyperlinks</h4><hr />
           <p>"Hyper" comes from the Greek word for a two-year-old toddler who has eaten a king-size bag of Skittles. No wait. That's not right. "Hyper" actually comes from the Greek word "huper," which means "over, beyond." Hyperlinking gives words, phrases, or images the ability to open a new page when selected.</p>

           <h4>Example:</h4>
           <div class="well">
           <p>If you are interested in space and photography, take a look at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/iotd.html" target="_blank" class="external-link">NASA's Image of the Day</a> gallery. </p>

            <div class="content">
                Make sure your hyperlinks reinforce and enhance your document, like providing
                essential background or contextual information, references, or definitions. Avoid overusing hyperlinks.

           <p>Using a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Table:</strong> an arrangement of data in rows and columns" data-position="top">table</span> to present complex information is more effective than using text alone. For example, consider this scenario:</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a table to organize the family's weekly chores.
