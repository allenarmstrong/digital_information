    <h2>Table Formatting&mdash;Text Version</h2>

    <p>Now that you have a basic table, let's dress it up a little. You will notice the <strong>Design and Layout</strong> ribbons have now appeared. </p>
    <p>To change the design of your table, go to the <strong>Design</strong> ribbon and select a table style.</p>
    <p>Next, make your tasks stand out by highlighting each task in a specific color. Choose the cell you want to highlight, in this case "Dishes," select "Cell Shading," and the color yellow. Repeat this step for all cells that contain the word "Dishes." </p>
    <p>We'll do the same cell shading with the "Trash" task. This time we'll highlight in blue. </p><p> Next, use these steps to highlight each task in a different color. This makes your table easy to read at a glance.</p>
