     	 	 <h2>Finding and Replacing </h2>
<hr />
<p>Searching your document for a particular word can feel like trying to find Waldo! However, Word Online has two features to speed up your search: Find and Replace.</p>
<hr /><h2>Find<br>
</h2>
<p>The "Find" tab searches your document for particular content—like a certain word, phrase, punctuation mark, etc. This saves you from having to re-read your whole document to find the information. Instead, you can follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Select "Find" from the Home Ribbon. </li>
<li>Type the word you want to find in the box. 
</li>
<li>Select the magnifying glass to search the document. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example. Notice the author searched for the word "access" and found three instances in the document.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
   
<hr /><h2>Replace<br>
</h2>
<p>Oh no! You just realized you repeatedly referred to Edgar <em>Allan</em> Poe as Edgar <em>Allen</em> Poe like a hundred times in your English essay. That would normally take forever to fix, but the Replace tab can correct every instance of this error in a few seconds. To use this feature, follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Select "Replace" from the Home Ribbon. </li>
<li>Type the word you want to find in the top or "Search for&hellip;" box. 
</li>
<li>Type the word you want to use as a replacement in the "Replace with&hellip;" box. 
</li>
<li>You can either replace individual instances or replace all instances of the word. 
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Select the individual box in which the word appears and select "Replace." 
</li>
<li>Select "Replace All" to replace all instances. </li></ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Look at the following example. They decided to replace the last instance of the word "access" with the word "connection."  
</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<p>By selecting the final box and then the "Replace" button, "access" is replaced with "connection" in the last line. </p>

<li>Highlight the word you want to find and select "Replace" from the Home Ribbon. </li>
<li>The word you found will be in "Find" section, or type a new word you want to find in the top or "Search for&hellip;" box. 
</li>
<li>Type the word you want to use as a replacement in the "Replace with&hellip;" box. 
</li>
<li>You can either replace individual instances or replace all instances of the word.

<p><em>Note:</em> If you only need to see where the word or phrase was used, you would just use the "Find" feature; instead of "Replace.”</p>
