<hr />
<p>Word Online gives plenty of options for making sure you create the spacing your teacher requires for that oh-so-important research paper. Let's explore. Type the following into a blank Word document:</p>
<div class="well bold">
<p>Digital Information Technology is an exciting course. I, _________________, am going to learn all about Office Online during the _________ school year. I will start by learning Word Online. Word Online is a word processing software that I will use to write reports. Word Online will allow me to access my work anywhere I have connection to the internet. This means I can work on my report while at a friend's house and I don't even have to bring my own computer. </p>
<p>I will also learn how to use Excel Online. Excel Online is a spreadsheet software. Many businesses use Excel to help with analyzing their costs. People also use Excel at home to budget their household income.
</p>
<p>Another great online tool that I will use is PowerPoint Online. PowerPoint Online is a presentation software that I will use to give presentations in class. Since my work will be saved in the cloud, I no longer have to worry about forgetting to bring my presentation to school because I will be able to access it from any computer that has internet connection.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, watch this <em>Spacing in Word</em> video and make the following changes to the spacing on the text you typed above:</p>


      <div class="htmltext_version" data-src="textversion/02_03_09/textversion_01.htm">
        <div id="1_0q41uuy1" class="kaltura center-block" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-uiconfid="35766781"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="clearfix"><br>
</div>
<p>Save the file to your OneDrive using the file name format: LastNameFirstName_Spacing. For example, if your name is John Smith, you would save the file as "SmithJohn_Spacing.‚Äù</p>
</div>
