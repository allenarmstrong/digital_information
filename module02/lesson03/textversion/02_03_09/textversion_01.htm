<h2>Spacing in Word&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Let's go over how to modify paragraph and line settings. </p>
  <p>To change the line spacing, place your cursor at the beginning of a paragraph and select the "Line Spacing" button. A line spacing of 2 will change the spacing for this paragraph to double-spaced. </p>
  <p>To change the indentation of a paragraph, select the "Special Indent" button. Selecting the "First Line" will indent the first line of your paragraph. Selecting the "Hanging" option will indent all but the first line of your paragraph. </p>
  <p>To modify your paragraph settings, select the pop-out arrow from the paragraph box. </p>
  <p>Under "Spacing‚Äù, change the "After" value to 0 and the "At" value to 1.0. Select "OK" and you should see a small adjustment in the paragraph spacing.</p>
