<h2>Creating a List&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <p>Today, we're going to cover modifying fonts and creating lists to enhance a document. </p>
  <p>To create a numbered list, select the "Numbering" button and begin typing out your list. After each line, hit "Enter" and the formatting will automatically number for you. </p>
  <p>To modify the font style, highlight all of the text and select your formatting. Here, we'll change the entire font style to Arial at 12 pt. font. </p>
  <p>Next, we'll format each line separately. First we'll bold, then italicize, underline, highlight in yellow, and finally, change the font color to red. </p>
