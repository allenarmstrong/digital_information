  <p>Hi Carrie...<br>
    <br>
    Wow, thanks for the tip about this new app. This could be HUGE if it's real!<br>
    <br>
    I'd like to meet with you in person today to find out more: who the kids are, where they are, and all the information I'll need to make this a great story.<br>
    <br>
    Can you meet with me this afternoon?<br>
    <br>
    See you soon, I hope!</p>
  <p>Be sure to close with your name and a signature.</p>
  <br>
