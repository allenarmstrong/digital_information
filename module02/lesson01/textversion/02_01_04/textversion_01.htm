<h2>Keyboard Key Functions</h2>
<hr />
  <p>The <strong>home keys</strong> are the middle row of letter keys on the keyboard: ASDF and JKL;. When beginning to type, rest your fingers on these keys. Use your pointer fingers to locate the F and J keys on your keyboard. Do you feel a small bump on these keys? If so, that is to help you locate the home keys without looking at the keyboard. When your fingers are not resting on the home keys, they are extending out to the other keys.</p>
  <p>Your thumbs should float above the <strong>space bar</strong> when not in use.</p>
  <p>The <strong>shift keys </strong>allow you to capitalize letters and access the symbols on the number row. To capitalize or use a symbol on the number row, hold down the shift button and the letter you want to capitalize or the symbol you wish to use.</p>
  <p>The <strong>enter key</strong> is used to drop down to a new line. Use your right-hand pinkie to hit the enter key.</p>
  <p>The <strong>tab key</strong> automatically moves the cursor five spaces to the right in a document, which is called indenting. Use your left-hand pinkie to hit the tab key.</p>
  <p>The <strong>backspace key</strong> moves back one space to delete the letter behind the cursor. Use your right-hand pinkie to hit the backspace key.</p>
  <p>When the <strong>caps lock key </strong>is on, it creates all capital letters without having to hold down the shift key. Use your left-hand pinkie to turn the caps lock on and off.</p>
