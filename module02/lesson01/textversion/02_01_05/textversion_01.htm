  <h2>Creating New Folders&mdash;Text Version</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>Let's get organized. We'll start by creating folders in OneDrive so you can easily find your files. </p>
  <p>To create a folder, select "New" and then "Folder." </p>
  <p>Give the folder an appropriate name and select "Create." You should now see your new folder appear in your OneDrive. </p>
  <p>You can make as many folders as you want, but remember to keep files organized so they are easy to find when you need them. </p>
