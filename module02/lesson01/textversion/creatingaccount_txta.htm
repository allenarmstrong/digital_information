    <h2>How to Create an Office Account&mdash;Text Version</h2>
    <p>To create an Office Online account, go to www.office.com and select "My account." </p>
    <p>If you already have an account, you can sign in. If you're not sure if you have an account, they've got a nifty
        button for that. And if you need to create one, you can do so by selecting "Sign up for a new account." </p>
    <p>Enter your <span class="lang" data-term="email">email</span> address and choose a password. If you're not a fan
        of getting regular <span class="lang" data-term="email">email</span>s from Microsoft, go ahead and uncheck this
        box. Select "
        Create Account" and now you have an office.com account.</p>
