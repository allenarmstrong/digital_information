<h2>Picking up the PACE</h2>
<hr />
      <p>Imagine it's Sunday afternoon, and you're working on a project due Monday in your science class. You realize you misplaced the instructions and don't know what comes next in the experiment. There is no way to reach your teacher or get a copy of the directions.</p>
      
      <p>Now imagine clicking a button and having immediate access to the resources you need to finish the project. This is essentially what communication technologies are doing for the workplace. They are increasing and improving productivity, accessibility, collaboration, and efficiency (PACE).</p>
      
      <p>Select each letter to see how communication tools pick up the PACE: </p>
