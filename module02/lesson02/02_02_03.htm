Could you be the <em>Guinness World Records</em> holder for having the most unread emails in your inbox? These days, in addition to getting work and personal emails, people also receive a lot of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Spam:</strong> unsolicited and undesired email messages" data-position="top">spam</span>, which makes it difficult to distinguish between important messages and junk mail. Luckily, you can reduce the spam that appears in your inbox and send it directly to the "Junk Mail" folder. You also have the ability to manage who is allowed to send you email messages. Follow the steps below to manage your settings and automatically move emails to your junk folder.</p>
