 <hr />
<p>Take a moment to meet T.D. (his real name is Troglodyte, after his great-great-great grandfather). T.D. has practically lived in a cave his whole life. If you can believe it, he has never even heard of email! That's where you come in. T.D. desperately needs to get with the 21st century and learn the basics of email, so he can communicate efficiently and productively in and out of the workplace. By the end of this lesson, you will have the skills to teach T.D. what he needs to know about using email effectively. </p><br><br>
