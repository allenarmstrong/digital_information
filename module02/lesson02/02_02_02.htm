  <h2>Email Essentials</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>Over the years, there have been many methods of sending and receiving messages: messages in a bottle, singing telegrams, Post-It Notes on the fridge. Then email came along. Email is a technology that has made interacting with others&mdash;especially in the workplace&mdash;fast, efficient, affordable, productive, and even profitable.<br>

 <p>Companies frequently use email to market goods and services. In fact, according to a 2015 Mailjet survey, U.S. companies send an average of 1.47 million emails per month. Time to do a little math: Multiply 1.47 million by .49 cents (the cost of a first-class stamp). Do you have the answer? (Seriously, we’re not telling you what it is.) Now, imagine spending <em>that</em> each month to send mail through the post office. Not only has email reduced postage costs, it has eliminated labor costs, since stuffing and addressing envelopes and licking stamps is no longer necessary.  </p>

<p>Odds are you probably already know how to open and send email messages. However, email has many other capabilities that 21st century workers can use to enhance their communication and productivity. Let's go through the different functions you can utilize when sending a message.<br>

 <div class="tabs" data-position="left">
    <a class="tab" title="header_title" >Signature Line<br>&nbsp;</a>
    <div class="panel">
        <h4>Signature Line</h4><hr />

           <p>Who wants to type out their signature at the end of <em>every</em> email? (Especially if your name is similar to Hubert Blaine Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff's.) The good news is that you can create an automated signature line, so your signature automatically appears at the end of your email. </p>

          <h4>Adding Contacts</h4><hr />

           <p>Imagine if you had to remember all your friend's and family's phone numbers and email addresses off the top of your head. That is a brain-bending idea for most. In Outlook.com, the People app is the place to add all your contacts, so you can access them later with a click, swipe, or tap.</p>
        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <div class="well">

<hr />
           <p>Think about a grocery store. It is full of pretty much one thing: food. But the food is organized by groups, which makes it easy to find your favorite cereal or the mac ‘n’ cheese. You can use this same type of efficient organization with your contacts. </p>

          <h4>Composing and Sending New Messages</h4>
<hr />
           <p>You probably know how to create and send an email, but there are some optional features, like sending a blind carbon copy and adding a priority designation, that may be new concepts.</p>
        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <div class="well">
            <ol>
          <li>Select <strong><span class="dbtip">New<span><img src="images/02_02_03a_new.jpg" width="200" alt="New" /></span></span></strong>.</li>
<li>Add a recipient by doing one of the following:
 <ul>
          <li>To send to an individual or group IN your contact list, select "To" and then choose a recipient(s) from the list.
</li>
<li>To send to an individual NOT IN your contact list, manually type in the recipient's email address in the blank field.
</li>
<li><em>Optional:</em> If you need to send a copy of the email to additional recipients, add their email addresses in the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Cc field</strong>: Cc: stands for &ldquo;carbon copy,&rdquo; which is a copy of the original">Cc&nbsp;field</span>. If you want to send a copy of the email to additional recipients but do not want the original recipient to know, use the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Bcc field</strong>: Bcc: stands for &ldquo;blind carbon copy,&rdquo; which means the original recipient cannot see additional recipients of the email">Bcc&nbsp;field</span>.
</li>
          </ul>
</li>

<li>Add the subject of your email in the "Add a subject" field. <em>Note:</em> Be concise. For example, write "<em>Rent</em> Audition" instead of "I am interested in auditioning for <em>Rent</em>.”
</li>
<li>Compose (write) your message in the blank space below the <strong><span class="dbtip">text&nbsp;formatting&nbsp;toolbar<span><img src="images/02_02_03a_toolbar.jpg" height="20" width="300" alt="text formatting toolbar" /></span></span></strong>. 
<ul>
<li><em>Optional:</em> You can add a priority designation by using the dropdown arrow next to <strong><span class="dbtip">Options<span><img src="images/02_02_03a_options.jpg" width="75" alt="Options" /></span></span></strong> and selecting the <strong><span class="dbtip">priority&nbsp;level<span><img src="images/02_02_03a_priority.jpg" width="125" alt="priority level" /></span></span></strong>. <em>Note about priority levels: </em> The default priority is Normal. If a message is time sensitive or of high importance to you or the sender, it is appropriate to use High priority.
</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>Select <strong><span class="dbtip">Send<span><img src="images/02_02_03a_send.jpg" width="200" alt="Send" /></span></span></strong>.</li>
