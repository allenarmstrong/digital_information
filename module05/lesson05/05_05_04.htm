        <p>Imagine if you were going to take a trip. You wouldn't just get into the car (supposing you had a carâ€”oh, and a driver's license!) and start driving. You would decide on a destination, map your route, and pack what you need. Reading and researching are also better when you're prepared for the endeavor. A note-taking template can help you prepare for and organize your research by doing these things:</p>

      

        <ul>
            <li>Record information by <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Paraphrasint:</strong> rewording of something in one's own word" data-position="top">paraphrasing</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Summarize:</strong> to briefly restate the main points" data-position="top">summarizing</span>, or using <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Direct quote:</strong> using an author's language word-for-word with quotation marks " data-position="top">direct quotes</span>
             from the text.</li>

            <li>Collect available source information like author name, date of access, date of publication, page number, title, etc.</li>

            <li>Process your thoughts about the information you're reading.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Open the <strong>Research Note-taking Template</strong> <span class="tooltip" data-tip="&lt;strong&gt;PDF:&lt;/strong&gt; (Portable Document Format) a file format that provides an electronic image of a document and can be viewed, printed, and electronically transmitted" data-position="top">PDF</span> version <a href="pop/research_note.pdf" class="pop">here</a>. Don't have Acrobat Reader? Use the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="&lt;strong&gt;RTF:&lt;/strong&gt; (Rich Text Format) universal file format that can include information such as text style, size, and color and can be read by all word processors" data-position="right">RTF</span> version <a href="pop/research_note.rtf" class="pop">here</a>.</p>
