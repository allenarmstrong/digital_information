<h2><br>
SCRIPT&mdash;Text Version</h2>
<p><strong>S:</strong> Summarize, or briefly restate the main points, what you are reading in your own words. If you canâ€™t, use context clues(glossary rollover: Context Clues: hints that an author gives to help make meaning (i.e. synonyms, antonyms, explanations, definitions, prefixes, suffixes, roots) in or around the sentence with the unknown word ) or look up unknown words to help make meaning.</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> Connect what you are reading to what you already know. Using your background knowledge will help you make meaning. Ask yourself: What do I already know about this subject?</p>
<p><strong>R:</strong> Re-read parts that are unclear or confusing. Ask yourself these questions: What is happening? Why is it happening? How is it happening?  </p>
<p><strong>I:</strong> Imagine what the text would look like in pictures. If you can visualize what is happening, it will help you make meaning. If you can't visualize the text, that's a clue that you need to re-read. </p>
<p><strong>P:</strong> Predict, or make an educated guess based on clues, what might happen next. Even with technical documents, you can ask yourself questions like, "What step would logically come next?" </p>
<p><strong>T:</strong> Take your time! There is no sense reading through something quickly only to go back and re-read what you missed the first time. </p>
