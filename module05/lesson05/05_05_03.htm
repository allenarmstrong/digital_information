    <p>While these books are awesome, they won't adequately prepare you for the workplace. Why? Most entry-level job
        texts (think computer documents, graphs, manuals, operating instructions, research material, formal
        correspondence, etc.) are written at the level of a college textbook (1200+L)! This means it is critical for you
        to practice reading texts that will truly prepare you for the workplace. </p>
