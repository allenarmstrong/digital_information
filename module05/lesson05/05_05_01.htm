   <hr />
 
  <p>A long, long time ago (like in the 1990s), performing research meant going to the library, looking for sources in a card catalog, finding the resource material in the stacks, and then reading through the book to find information. Now, we have practically all the resources we need in one place: the internet. While the internet has made research easier, you still have to acquire the most relevant information and, more importantly, be able to comprehend it.    </p>
