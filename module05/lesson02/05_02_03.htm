    	 		 		 	<p>In 2014, Americans spent an average of 159 minutes on the internet each day. So anything that can make surfing, researching, checking email, finding addresses, and visiting favorite websites faster and easier is a good thing. GUI lets you <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Configure:</strong> arrange or order a computer system, or an element of it, so as to fit it to a designated task" data-position="top">configure</span> your browser any way you wish. </p><p>Here are the basics:  </p><br>

    	 		 		            	 <h4>Home Page</h4><hr/><p>Depending on which browser you use (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.), the directions for setting your <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Home page:</strong> a web page set as the default or start-up page on a browser" data-position="top">home page</span> vary slightly. However, all browsers have a "Settings" tab where you can locate the option to set your homepage. When you enter the web page URL address and save your selection, your browser will automatically open to your designated page.  </p>

Most browsers have a bookmark icon (like a star) on the toolbar that you can select in order to bookmark a website. When you open your bookmarks, you can select a website to visit, delete a website you no longer want saved, change the default website name, and re-arrange your list alphabetically.</p>

What font style and size is easiest for you to read? These are just some examples of the different settings you can configure in order to make your browser more efficient and enjoyable. The "Settings" tab is where you go to manage your <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Preferences:</strong> user-specified settings" data-position="top">preferences</span>. </p>

Occasionally though, you may have to do a manual setup. In this case, you need the following information to complete the configuration: the type of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Email Server:</strong> Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3), Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)" data-position="top">email server</span> your email provider uses for incoming and outgoing email, and the incoming and outgoing server addresses. The good news is you don't need to understand the details of these types of servers, just what kind your email uses. </p>

The browser has default security settings, but you can also configure the browser's security to suit your needs. The "Settings" tab gives you the option to manage how websites monitor your online activity by deciding which <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Cookies:</strong> small files that websites put on your PC to store information about you and your preferences" data-position="right">cookies</span> are stored, how websites are tracked, whether to block or allow <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Pop-up:</strong> a window that appears suddenly on a computer screen often for advertising" data-position="top">pop-ups</span>, and customize the security settings to reduce the risk of <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Virus:</strong> a program that is intended to interfere with computer, tablet, or smartphone operations and can be spread from one device to another" data-position="top">viruses</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Malware:</strong> software intended to damage or take partial control of a computer, tablet, or smartphone" data-position="top">malware</span>, or <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Hacker:</strong> a person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to a computer's data" data-position="right">hackers</span>. </p>
