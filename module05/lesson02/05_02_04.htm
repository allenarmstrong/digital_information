Who cares! <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Search engines:</strong> a software system designed to search for information on the World Wide Web" data-position="top">Search engines</span> like Google, Bing, and Yahoo! have revolutionized research and inquiry. Now, instead of heading to a library, using a card catalog to find possible resources, and then reading through countless pages to get the needed information, search engines can be opened in a browser on computers, smartphones, tablets, and other devices with internet access. However, with the vast amount of web pages, sometimes simply typing a word into Google gets too many results or results that aren't quite right. Using better search tactics can improve your search results.</p><p> Here are some tips: </p>
<ul><li>Focus on keywords, which are words used in a web search to find relevant web pages. </li>
<li>Use specific terms: for example, "red bicycle" instead of just bicycle. </li>
<li>Use quotation marks (" ") to search for exact phrases (i.e. "solar systems," "social media," "feta cheese").</li> 
<li>Do not use unnecessary articles (like "the" or "a"), prepositions (like "to" or "from"), or pronouns (like "he" or "they"), which won't help the search. Stick to concrete nouns. </li>
<li>Use correct spelling and capitalization to optimize results.</li></ul> 	 	<br>
