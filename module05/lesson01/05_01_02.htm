You know what the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Internet:</strong> the global communication network that allows almost all computers worldwide to connect and exchange information" data-position="top">internet</span> is. It's what you connect to in order to access Instagram, use Google, and watch YouTube videos. But have you ever wondered what the internet looks like on the inside? </p> <p>If you could take an x-ray of the internet, you would see it is comprised of the following: </p>
    	 		 	
<ul><li>The pages we view: GUI (graphic user interface), which contain a header, title, body, links, and screen resolution. </li>
<li>The <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Coding:</strong> converting the symbolic arrangement of statements or instructions in a computer program into another symbolic arrangement, usually in an encoded or unreadable form" data-position="top">coding</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Formatting:</strong> arranging data for computer input or output, such as the number and size of fields in a record or the spacing and punctuation of information in a report" data-position="top">formatting</span> behind the pages we view: http, https, CSS, JavaScript, DHTML, and HTML. </li>
<li>The different <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Web browser:</strong> a software application for retrieving, presenting, and navigating information resources on the World Wide Web" data-position="top">web browsers</span> with <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Cross-platform compatability:</strong> a language, software application, or hardware device that works on more than one system platform" data-position="top">cross-platform compatibility</span> available for most operating systems: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Apple Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. </li></ul>
<p>That's the basic skeleton, though there are millions of veins, tendons, and ligaments (also known as <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Network:</strong> a group of computer systems and other computing hardware devices linked together to enable communication and resource-sharing among a wide range of users" data-position="top">networks</span>) running throughout the internet too. </p><br>	 	 	</div>
