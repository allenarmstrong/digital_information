    		 		  <h2>The Other Nets</h2><hr />      	
<p>In addition to the internet, there are two other types of nets used frequently in business settings: <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Intranet:</strong> a private local network accessible only to an organization's staff" data-position="top">intranet</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Extranet:</strong> an intranet that is partially accessible to authorized people outside the business or organization" data-position="top">extranet</span>. (Here is a prime example of when knowledge of root words comes in handy, by the way.)  </p><img src="images/network_ts.png"

<hr /><h2>Intranet</h2>
<p>An organization, like a school or company, has an intranet so staff can access and share internal information quickly and safely. Intranets streamline communication, quickly circulate news and information, and allow staff to work from remote locations. Since many organizations keep <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Copyright:</strong> the exclusive legal right, given to an originator or creator, to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same" data-position="top">copyrighted</span> information on intranets, security is important. To access an intranet, authorized users log into the organization's network with a username and password.   </p>
<hr /><h2>Extranet</h2>
<p>When an organization hires outside vendors to provide additional services, the vendors are given limited access to the organization's intranet. This practice saves time for everyone and reduces email usage. Most times, vendors are not given access to an organization's entire intranet in order to protect private information and data. This is one way for an organization to maintain <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Regulatory Control:</strong> limitations imposed on the activities of an organization in compliance with the organization's regulations" data-position="top">regulatory control</span> over who accesses its intranet.
