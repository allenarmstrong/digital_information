    <h2>Where Are You Going?</h2><hr>  	<p><br>Unlike "LOL" and "IDK," URL is not an abbreviation that most people know off the top of their heads. It stands for <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Uniform Resource Locator:</strong> the global address of documents and other resources on the internet" data-position="top">Uniform Resource Locator</span>, and it's how the internet knows where to take you when you type an address into your browser.  </p><p>A URL is a formatted string of text that web browsers, email applications, and other software programs use to identify a particular resource on the internet. Most URLs are located in the address bar of a web browser and consist of three separate parts (called substrings):</p>
  <p>  <ul><li><strong>Network Protocol</strong> – A system of rules that defines how internet resources get communicated on a network  </li>
<li><strong>Host</strong> – The computer or other network device where the resource is located </li> 
<li><strong>Resource Location</strong> – The path to a particular network resource on the host</li></ul><br>
