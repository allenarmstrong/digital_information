            <p>You have probably noticed websites have different URL endings, which are called <span class="tooltip"
                                                                                                     data-tip="<strong>Top-level Domains:</strong> website suffixes like .com, .edu, .gov, .mil, and .org"
                                                                                                     data-position="top">top-level domains</span>
                (TLD). The various endings for URLs are based on certain factors like whether the website is part of a
                <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Commercial:</strong> intended to make a profit"
                      data-position="top">commercial</span> entity or <span class="tooltip"

    <h2>Country Protocols</h2>
    <p>
        There are also certain protocols for URLs in different countries. For example, websites in the United Kingdom
        end in ".uk," while a website from Finland ends in ".fi." In addition, more than 20 countries employ an
        extension of ".co" before their country domain extension to indicate that the website is for a company or to
        signify there is commercial content on the website. Here is an example of a URL for the British Broadcasting
        Corporation: http://www.bbc.co.uk. </p>
