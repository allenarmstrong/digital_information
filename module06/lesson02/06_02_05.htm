<p>If you are going to build a house, you need a blueprint. And if you're going to create a web page, you need a wireframe and a storyboard. A <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Wireframe:</strong> a sketch detailing where text and images will be placed on a website" data-position="top">wireframe</span> is a mock-up of your web page that sketches out where text and images will be placed, so you get a visual image of the page's <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Layout:</strong> the arrangement of content" data-position="top">layout</span>. Once you have the wireframe, begin the <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Storyboard:</strong> a plan that depicts the sequence of the key content" data-position="top">storyboard</span> which is essentially an outline of your web page's <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Content:</strong> the subjects or topics expressed in writing, images, video, hyperlink, etc." data-position="top">content</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Design:</strong> the arrangement or pattern of elements in a work of art, web page, room, outfit, etc." data-position="top">design</span>. These planning tools show you the big picture and allow you to make revisions if necessary. Maybe your color scheme doesn't complement your graphics or your text is too long. It's easier and more efficient to make changes to your wireframe and storyboard than your actual web page. </p>

<p>Here are five tips for successful wireframing and storyboarding: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Establish the <strong>purpose</strong> of your web page. <em>Why are you creating the web page? What do you hope to achieve? What is your message? Who will your audience be? </em></li>
	<li>Gather information about your <strong>audience</strong>. <em>Who are they? What do they like? What are the trends with this audience? How can you keep them interested?</em> </li>
	<li>Find <strong>design</strong> inspiration! Go to your favorite web pages and see how color, fonts, and images are used. Look at the placement of headings and text, too. What do you like about these web pages, and what do you think could be improved? </li> 
	<li>Add the <strong>visual appeal</strong>. Use what you have learned about your audience and what you have seen on popular web pages to choose a color scheme, font style, and images that will enhance your overall design. </li>
	<li><strong>Reflect</strong> and <strong>revise</strong>. After your storyboard is complete, take an objective look at your sketch and determine areas that could be enhanced. Your colors, images, and text should all work together to create a cohesive, purposeful, and eye-catching web page that users will want to return to. </li></ol>
