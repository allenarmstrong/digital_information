  <h2>What Color Should I Use?</h2><hr />
  <p>When you choose colors for a web page, it's not only important to use the principles of color theory but you must also take your target audience into consideration. Decide what colors will appeal to them (not you) by considering these elements of your audience: age, class, culture, gender, and trends.  
Keep in mind that color is not used just as decoration on a web page; it also has functional purposes. The strategic use of color on a web page can do the following: </p>
<ul><li>Create a visual contrast, so your audience can see at a glance what is important and what is minor </li>
<li>Define functional regions of the page like navigation buttons and links  </li>
<li>Group page elements that are related, so users can see structure/pattern in the content </li></ul>
<p>In a nutshell, choose your colors wisely so they appeal to your target audience and help users navigate your web page easily. </p>

Select each image to learn how these elements contribute to the visual impact of a web page. <p>

                   <p>Like people, fonts have personalities and come in all shapes and sizes. Therefore, you must follow some general rules when selecting your font style and size: 
<ul><li>Know the font's personality. Select one that aligns to the personality of your web page. </li>
<li>Use two contrasting fonts—one for headings and one for text. Use those two fonts throughout for consistency. </li>
<li>Use legible fonts. Scripts and decorative fonts may look nice, but if they’re hard to read it defeats the purpose.</li> 
<li>Select the right size. Headings should be larger than text.</li></ul>                  </div>

                      <p>It's tempting to fill up blank space with pictures, but images must be purposeful and fit with your web page's overall design. Here are some general rules for selecting effective images: <ul><li>Use images that relate to your web page's content. </li>
<li>Select images that complement your web page's color scheme.</li>
<li>Choose images that align with your web page's personality.</li> 
<li>Be aware of the licensing restrictions with images. Most are copyrighted.</li></ul>                  </div>
