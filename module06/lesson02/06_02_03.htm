<p>The theory of relativity and quantum theory are two important scientific theories. However, there is another important principle that dates all the way back to the 15th century and shows up in today's advertisements, book covers, fashion shows, living rooms, web pages, and even this course—<span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Color theory:</strong> a philosophy regarding the mixing of colors and specific combinations of colors" data-position="top">color theory</span>.

        <hr/>
  <br/>
<p> The <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Color wheel:</strong> a circle with different colored sections used to show the relationship between colors" data-position="right">color wheel</span> was developed by Sir Isaac Newton by taking the color spectrum and bending it into a circle. It is made up of three different types of colors: primary, secondary, and tertiary. </p>

<h4>Primary Colors </h4>
 <br/>  
<p>The <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Primary colors:</strong> red, yellow, and blue, which are used to create all other colors on the color wheel" data-position="right">primary colors</span> are red, yellow, and blue. They are called primary for two reasons. First, no two colors can be mixed to create a primary color. Second, all other colors found on the color wheel can be created by mixing primary colors together. </p>

<h4>Secondary Colors</h4> 
 <br/>
<p>The <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Secondary colors:</strong> orange, green, and purple; these colors are created by mixing equal parts of any two primary colors" data-position="right">secondary colors</span> are orange, green, and purple. Secondary colors are created by mixing equal parts of any two primary colors. For example, yellow and blue create green, red and blue create purple, and red and yellow create orange. </p>

<h4>Tertiary Colors </h4>
<br/>
<p><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Tertiary colors:</strong> red-purple, red-orange, blue-green, yellow-green, blue-purple, and yellow-orange; these are created by mixing equal parts of a secondary and primary color together" data-position="right">Tertiary colors</span> are created by mixing equal parts of a secondary color and a primary color together. There are six tertiary colors: red-purple, red-orange, blue-green, yellow-green, blue-purple, and yellow-orange.

           <p><span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Contrast:</strong> the difference between light and dark areas " data-position="right">Contrast</span> deals with using colors that are very different from each other, such as lights and darks, to help content stand out. When the degree of contrast between items is high, the content is easier to see and read. Notice how the lemon on a blue background is more prominent (high contrast) than the green and purple kale on a yellow background (less contrast). </p>
