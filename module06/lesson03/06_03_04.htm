<p>Imagine you are creating a web page. You finished your wireframe and storyboard, so now you are ready to begin writing code. At this stage, many web developers use a program called a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>WYSIWYG:</strong> an editor or program that allows a developer to see what the end result will look like while the interface or document is being created" data-position="top">WYSIWYG</span> editor, which stands for "What You See Is What You Get" (also known as "Wizzy-Wig”). These editors show exactly what the end result of the HTML coding will look like. This is especially awesome when using images. Instead of seeing the HTML code, you can see the actual picture.</p>

<p>Developers can explore the page layout, moving text and images around the page, <em>before</em> publishing the page on the web. While WYSIWYG editors are handy, they are not always accurate in their display of the code. For this reason, web developers <strong>must</strong> know HTML coding and not rely on these editors to supply code for them.</p>
