     	 	 	<h2>Picture This</h2><hr /> 	 		  	<p>There is a reason over 80 million pictures are posted to Instagram per day: images attract. For a web page to capture a user's interest, it must include the <em>right</em> <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Image:</strong> a picture that is produced by a camera, artist, mirror, etc." data-position="top">images</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Graphics:</strong> drawings, diagrams, graphs, mathematical curves, symbols, etc." data-position="top">graphics</span>. The most effective pictures to use on a web page should be relevant to the content, aid the viewer's comprehension, support the overall purpose, and create the appropriate emotion. Select the images to see how they can complement content:</p>

                   <p>Notice how this image could be used for a professional organizer, a fashion stylist, a personal blogger, etc. While it's good to be versatile, the most effective images and graphics will relate specifically and directly to the content. Avoid using general images. Select ones that are so precise they could almost replace the text on your page.               </p>    </div>

                      <p>For someone creating a cooking blog, adding pictures of the ingredients in a recipe or the final product makes the web page more appealing to viewers. Plus, it assists visual learners by showing what ingredients they will need for the recipe, which is more effective than text alone. Always select images and graphics that will help your viewer's comprehension.      </p>         </div>

                   <p>Web pages can advertise products and services, so the images should reflect the page's purpose. For example, a personal trainer should use actual images of a training session, gym equipment, etc., as opposed to random images that are not related to the service (even if they look good). </p>

                      <p>Images appeal to people's emotions, so it's important to choose pictures that create the right mood to achieve your purpose. For example, a dog shelter seeking families to adopt homeless dogs should use images that create a sense of sympathy; a picture of a happy dog would not produce a sense of urgency or suffering. If you choose images that set the right mood, this can be a very persuasive technique. </p>
