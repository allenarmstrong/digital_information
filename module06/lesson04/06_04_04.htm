He comes across another article titled "The Importance of Web-based Applications" and dives in. He learns that a <span class="tooltip" data-tip="<strong>Web-based application:</strong> Any application that runs in an Internet browser and depends on a browser in order for the application to be used" data-position="top">web-based application</span> is any application that runs in an Internet browser and depends on a browser in order for the application to be used. He learns that web-based applications are important and needed for several benefits that they offer:</p><br> 	 	<ul> 		<li>convenience - applications can be accessed at any time, from anywhere</li> 		<li>access - web-based applications run on an online server, so an Internet connection and a computer is all you need</li> 		<li>cross-platform availability - even if users only have access to a tablet when away from their office, they will likely be able to access what they need</li> 		<li>maintenance-free - users don't have to worry about doing updates, as the application's owners do all updates</li> 		<li>compatibility - an application doesn't have to worry about any hardware settings in the operating system that might cause issues</li> 	</ul>  	<p>As John can see, web-based applications are great to use, and satisfy a lot of needs in this fast-paced world we live in.</p>  	<br class="clearfix">   </div>
